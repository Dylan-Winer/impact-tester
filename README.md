Program files for impact testing program.

Drop weight impact testing determines the strength of a material by measuring the energy absorbed along with the sample’s fractures. Engineers use impact testing to ascertain the durability of a material and to ensure safety and reliability. This study aimed to develop a Python program that receives a video or live stream and outputs the impulse force of a collision, thereby validating the impact tester’s measurements. Digital cameras were placed at a constant distance from the impact tester with a tape measure in view, and green sticky notes were stuck to the drop mass. After, the OpenCV library was implemented to detect the mass color values within the green RGB range, and a timer recorded the start and stop points of movement. Then the velocity and acceleration were calculated using the position and time data, and with user input of mass and height through the PyQt Graphic User Interface, the impact force was found. The program accurately tracked the objects and returned plots of position, velocity, and acceleration.

Furthermore, the height and mass data precisely calculated the initial potential energy of the drop mass. From these findings, it can be concluded that Python can be used to measure the impact force of a drop weight collision, aiding engineers to find the strengths of materials more confidently. Moreover, there are limited programs that automatically calculate impact force, as most require human calculations. This program can also be used to track objects to determine other metrics, allowing for numerous applications.
